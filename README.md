# X-SAP-Page-Info-XPL
SAP SuccessFactors HXM Core 2005 - X-SAP-Page-Info Exploit

Is possible change the "X-SAP-Page-Info" and "c0-param0" parameter in POST request to 

```console
/ec/ajax/remote/call/plaincall/employeeProfilePageConfigControllerProxy.getHeader.dwr
```

This parameters can make you get access about information of other user.

For instance, changing the `user ID` parameter, in this PoC, I was retrived the information about other user.
`Some informations are obfuscated because this is an productive environment attack`

The request below, is an Burp proxy interception.
Here I'm changed the X-SAP-Page-Info parameter to show information about other user.

First, this request is my initial access, using my user (622708)






I was changed the user ID to access the Cyber Security Manager information of this company. (for NDA reasons I don't show more information about the request, only the result of attack)



This Flaw is reported to SAP in Incident number 633224/2020
