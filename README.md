# X-SAP-Page-Info Exploit
`SAP SuccessFactors HXM Core 2005` - X-SAP-Page-Info Exploit

Is possible change the `X-SAP-Page-Info` and `c0-param0` parameter in POST request to 

```console
/ec/ajax/remoting/call/plaincall/employeeInfoControllerProxy.decodeUserId.dwr
```

This parameters can make you get access about information of other user.

For instance, changing the `user ID` parameter, in this PoC, I was retrived the information about other user.
`Some informations are obfuscated because this is an productive environment attack`

The request below, is an Burp proxy interception.
Here I'm changed the X-SAP-Page-Info parameter to show information about other user.

First, this request is my initial access, using the user (622708)
